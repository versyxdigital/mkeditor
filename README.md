## Developer Documentation 

MKEditor is split into two components: the browser-based renderer and the Electron desktop application. The browser renderer is a standalone web app, designed for markdown editing directly in the browser. The Electron app wraps the browser renderer, adding desktop-specific features such as file system access, native dialogs, and offline support.

## AI Usage Policy

MKEditor occasionally uses [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex) as an **augmentative tool** for tasks such as generating documentation, boilerplate code, and expanding on **existing ideas**. This is strictly to speed up the development flow. All AI-assisted contributions are reviewed, verified, and refined manually before inclusion.
